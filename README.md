# NAP

NAP is an example project produced solely for demonstration purposes.  There is no actual business usage and no open source benefits to anyone outside of myself.

The NAP project is an overall project that can host many sub projects.

Currently the NAP Demo app is the only project hosted underneath the NAP master solution.

If other NAP projects are required, the will be placed under this repo.

Please proceed to the sub project of interest for further details.

Thanks,
