This is a Demo app for a prospective client.  This code has no other purpose than to demonstrate current coding ability.

NOTE: The actual implementation is in the Demo folder, please navigate to Demo to access the Visual Studio solutions/code.

## Demo Requirements

1. Create a Web API project that leverages a RESTful architectural style and the HTTP protocol. You
can use the IAccountRepository interface as your data methods. Production quality code, unit
tests, DI/IoC etc. are all pluses.

2. Create a SPA Angular app that utilizes all the above REST apiâ€™s.

## Notes:
